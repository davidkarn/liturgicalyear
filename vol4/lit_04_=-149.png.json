Nothing,\nsurely, can be sweeter to them than to make such\na return; nothing could be more just. All they\nare, and all they have, and all the lovely creation\naround them, has been produced out of nothing by\nthe lavish munificence of this God; they must,\nthen, live for Him, faithful, loving, and grateful.\nHe asks them to give Him one only proof of this\nfidelity, love, and gratitude: He bids them not to\neat of the fruit of one single tree.
