Post paucos dies, reci-\npimur in carcerem: et ex-\npavi, quia nunquam exper-\nta eram tales tenebras. Mox\nrumor cucurrit utaudiremur.\nSupervenit autem et de civi-\ntate pater meus, consum-\nptus tedio; et ascendit ad\nme, ut me dejiceret, dicens:\nMiserere, filia, canis meis ;\nmiserere patri, si dignus\nsum a te pater vocari, A-\nspice ad fratres tuos, aspice\nad matrem tuam: aspice ad\nfilium tuum, qui post te vi-\nvere non poterit.

Et ego\ndolebam canos patris mei:\nquod solus de passione mea\ngavisurus non esset de toto\ngenere meo. Et confortavi\neum, dicens: Hoc fiet quod\nDeus voluerit.

A few\ndays after this, we were bap-\ntized ; and the Holy Ghost in-\nspired me to look on this Bap-\ntism as a preparation for bodily\nsuffering. A few more days\nelapsed, and we were sent to\nprison. I was terrified, for I\nwas not accustomed to such\ndarkness. The report soon\nspread that we were to be\nbrought to trial..! My father\nleft the city, for he was heart-\nbroken, and he came to me,\nhoping to shake my purpose.\nThese were his words to me:\n\u201cMy child, have pity on my\nold age. Have pity on thy\nfather, if I deserve to be called\nfather. Think of thy brothers,\nthink of thy mother, think of\nthy son, who cannot live when\nthou art gone. Give up this\nmad purpose, or thou wilt bring\nmisery upon thy family.\u201d\nWhilst saying this, which he\ndid out of love for me, he threw\nhimself at my feet, and wept\nbitterly, and said he besought\nthis of me not as his child, but\nas his lady. I was moved to\ntears to see my aged parent in\nthis, grief, for I knew that he\nwas the only one of my family\nthat would not rejoice at my\nbeing a martyr. I tried to con-\nsole him, and said: \u201cI will do\nwhatsoever God shall ordain.\nThou knowest that we belong to\nGod, and not to ourselves.\u201d\u201d He\nthen left me, and was very sad.\n\f"], [359, 131, 252, 35, "SEPTUAGESIMA\n\f"], [122, 126, 132, 40, "\f"]]}
