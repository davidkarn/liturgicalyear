The doors were then shut, and\nthe penitents were not to pass the threshold until\nMaundy Thursday, when they were to come and\nreceive absolution.\n\nDating from the eleventh century, the discipline\n\n\u2018of public penance began to fall into disuse, and the\n\nholy rite of putting ashes on the heads of all the\nfaithful indiscriminately became so general that, at\nlength, it was considered as forming an essential\npart of the Roman liturgy. Formerly, it was the\npractice to approach bare-footed to receive this\nsolemn memento of our nothingness; and in the\ntwelfth century, even the Rope himself, when\npassing from the church of St. Anastasia to that\nof St. Sabina, at which the station was held,\nwent the whole distance bare-footed, as also did the\nCardinals who accompanied him. The Church no\nlonger requires this exterior penance; but she is as\nanxious as ever that the holy ceremony, at which\nwe are about to assist, should produce in us the\nsentiments she intended to convey by it, when she\nfirst instituted it.\n\nAs we have just mentioned, the station in Rome\nis at St. Sabina, on the Aventine Hill. It is\nunder the patronage of this holy martyr that we\nopen the penitential season of Lent.\n\f"], [361, 141, 276, 34, "ASH WEDNESDAY\n\f"], [734, 137, 130, 39, "\f"]]}
