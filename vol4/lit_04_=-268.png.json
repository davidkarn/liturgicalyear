He is a son of the great patriarch\nSt. Benedict, and, like him, is the father of many\nchildren. The Benedictine family has a direct\nline from the commencement, even to this present\ntime; but, from the trunk of this venerable tree\nthere have issued four vigorous branches, to each\nof which the Holy Spirit has imparted the life and\nfruitfulness of the parent stem.

Vallombrosa, by\nJohn Gualbert; and Citeaux, by Robert of\nMolesmes.\n\nThe saint of this seventh day of February is\nRomuald. The martyrs whom we meet with on our\nway to Lent, give us an important lesson by the\ncontempt they had for this short life.

How they make us\nashamed of our own cowardice, which can scarcely\nbring itself to do the little that must be done to\nsatisfy God\u2019s justice and merit His grace!
