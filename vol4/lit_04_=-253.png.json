The saint was twice\nbrought before the governor,\nbut neither fair promises nor\nthreats could induce him to\noffer sacrifice to the gods.\nWhereupon, he was first beaten\nwith rods, and then his flesh\nwas torn with iron hooks while\nhe lay stretched on the rack.\nAt length he was beheaded, and\nnobly gave testimony to the\nfaith of Christ our Lord, on the\nthird of the Nones of February\n(February 3).\n\f"], [168, 266, 312, 760, "Blasius, Sebaste in Arme-\nnia cum virtutum laude flo-\nreret, ejusdem civitatis epi-\nscopus eligitur.
