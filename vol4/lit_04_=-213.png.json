He must put aside\neverything that could impede his progress, nor\nmust he look back. This is, undoubtedly, hard\ndoctrine; but if we reflect, for a moment, on the\ndangers which surround fallen man during his\nearthly pilgrimage, and on what our own sad expe-\nrience has taught us, we shall not think it hard or\nstrange, that our Saviour has made the renouncing\nand denying of ourselves an essential condition of\nour salvation. But, independently of this, is it not\nfar better to put our life under God\u2019s guidance,\nthan to keep it in our own ? Are we so wise or 80\nstrong, as to be able to guide ourselves? We may\nresist as we please, but God is our sovereign Lord\nand Master; and by giving us free-will, whereby we\nmay either resist His will or follow it, He has not\nabdicated His own infinite rights to His creatures\u2019\nobedience.
