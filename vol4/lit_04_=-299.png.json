If, therefore,\nAntioch is below Alexandria in rank, Alexandria\nnever enjoyed the honour granted to Antioch, of\nhaving been governed, in person, by him whom\nChrist appointed to be the supreme pastor of His\nChurch. Nothing, then, could be more just, than\nthat Antioch should be honoured, as having, for\nseven years, had the privilege of being the centre of\nChristendom; and this is the object of to-day\u2019s\nfeast.\n\nThe children of the Church have a right to feel a\nspecial interest in every solemnity that is kept in\nmemory of St. Peter. The father\u2019s feast is a feast\nfor the whole family; for to him it owes its very\nlife. If there be but one fold, it is because there is\nbut one Shepherd. Let us, then, honour Peter\u2019s\ndivine prerogative, to which Christianity owes \u2018its\npreservation; and let us often reflect upon the\nobligations we are under to the apostolic see. On\nthe feast of the chair at Rome, we saw how faith is\ntaught, and maintained, and propagated by the\nmother-Church, which has inherited the promises\nmade to Peter. To-day, let us consider the apostolic\nsee as the sole source of the legitimate power,\nwhereby mankind is ruled and governed in all that\nconcerns eternal salvation.\n\f"], [379, 134, 250, 46, "SEPTUAGESIMA\n\f"], [141, 128, 131, 40, "\f"]]}
