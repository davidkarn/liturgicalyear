The celebration of\nall these wondrous joys will take us seven weeks,\nas the great liturgists observe in their interpreta-\ntion of the rites of the Church. The seven joyous\nweeks from Haster to Pentecost will not be too long\nfor the future glad mysteries, which, after all, will\nbe but figures of a still gladder future, the future of\neternity.\n\nHaving heard these sweet whisperings of hope,\nlet us now bravely face the realities brought before\nus by our dear mother the Church.
