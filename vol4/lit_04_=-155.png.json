But\ndivine justice pronounces their condemnation, and\nthe sentence will be felt by their posterity, even to\nthe last generation. The two beings, that had\ncommitted the heinous crime, had been enriched\nwith every gift of nature and grace. It was not\nwith them, as it is with us. Concupiscence which\ngives us an inclination for what is wrong; ignorance\nand forgetfulness which cloud the intellect of fallen\nman, these miseries had nothing whatever to do\nwith the fall of our first parents. They sinned\nthrough sheer ingratitude. They began by weigh-\ning the proposal of revolt, when they ought to have\nspurned it with indignation and conquered by flight.\nThen, by degrees, the proposed crime seemed no\ngreat harm, because, though God would lose their\nobedience, they would gain by the disobedience!\nAnd at length, the love of God was made to give\nplace to the love of self, and they declared their\nindependence! Yet God had mercy on them,\nbecause of their posterity.\n\nThe angels were all created at one and the same -\ninstant, and each of them was subjected to the trial,\nwhich was to decide his eternal future. Hach\nangel depended on his own act, on his own choice\nbetween fidelity to his Creator and rebellion against\nHim ; so that they who rebelled drew on themselves\nthe eternity of God\u2019s chastisement. The human\nrace, on the contrary, existed not save as repre-\nsented in its two first parents, and was plunged by\nand with them into the abyss of God\u2019s reprobation :\ntherefore, God, who spared not the angels, merci-\nfully spared the human race.\n\f"], [381, 136, 249, 34, "SEPTUAGESIMA\n\f"], [145, 129, 130, 39, "\f"]]}
