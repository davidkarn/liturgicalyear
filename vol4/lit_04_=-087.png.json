Thou art come to my soul, that\nthou mayst be closely united with her, comfort her, give her\na new life, and bring her all good things. Oh! who will\nteach me how to value this grace, and thank thee for it ina\nbecoming way? But how shall I hope to value it as I ought,\nwhen I am not able to understand either the love that brings\nthee thus within me, or my own need of having thee? And\nwhen I think of my inability to make thee a suitable return of\nthanks, I feel as though I can give thee nothing but my\nspeechless gratitude. Yet thou willest that this my heart,\npoor as it is, should give thee its thanks; thou takest delight\nin receiving its worthless homage. Take it, then, my loving\nJesus! I give it thee with all possible joy, and beseech thee\nto reveal unto me the immensity of thy gift, and to enrich me\nmore that I may give thee more.\n\f"], [311, 799, 346, 35, "ACT OF THANKSGIVING\n\f"], [121, 285, 728, 490, "Thou art here within me, great God of heaven!
