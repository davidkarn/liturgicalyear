Let\nus, then, rouse ourselves, and prepare for the\nspiritual combat.\n\nBut in this battling of the spirit against the flesh\nwe need good armour. Our holy mother the Church\nknows how much we need it; and therefore does\nshe summon us to enter into the house of God,\nthat she may arm us for the holy contest. What\nthis armour is we know from St. Paul, who thus\ndescribes it: \u2018Have your loins girt about with\ntruth, and having on the breastplate of justice .\nAnd your feet shod with the preparation of the\nGospel of peace. In all things, taking the shield\nof faith. Take unto you the helmet of salvation,\nand the sword of the Spirit, which is the word\nof God.\u2019* The very prince of the apostles, too,\naddresses these solemn words to us: \u2018Christ having\nsuffered in the flesh, be ye also armed with the same\nthought.\u2019? We are entering, to-day, upon a long\ncampaign of the warfare spoken of by the apostles:\nforty days of battle, forty days of penance. We\nshall not turn cowards, if our souls can but be\nimpressed with the conviction, that the battle and\nthe penance must be gone through. Let us listen\nto the eloquence of the solemn rite which opens our\nLent. Let us go whither our mother leads us, that\nis, to the scene of the fall.\n\f"], [375, 133, 250, 33, "SEPTUAGESIMA\n\f"], [139, 126, 130, 40, "\f"]]}
