The first effect of this\nspirit of submission is, that it takes the soul from\nthe region of sin and death, wherein she was wasting |\naway her existence; it takes her from the dark\nChaldea, and places her in the promised land of\nlight. Lest she should faint on her way along the\nnarrow path, and fall a victim to the dangers which\nnever leave her because they are within herself,\nGod asks her for sacrifices, and these brace her.\nHere, again, we have Abraham for our model. God\nloves him, and promises him the richest of bless-\nings ; He gives him a son, as pledge of the promise;\nand then, shortly after, tests the holy patriarch\u2019s\ndevotedness, by commanding him to slay with his\nown hand this dear child, on whom he has been\ntold to build his hopes !\n\nMan\u2019s path on earth is sacrifice. We cannot go\nout from evil except by the way of self-resistance,\nnor keep our footing on good ground but by con-\nstant combating.

Christians!\ncan our treasure be in this wretched world? No\nit must be in that fair land above.
