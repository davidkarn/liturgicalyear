Thou,\nRomuald, didst not thus waste life away. It\nseemed to thee as though there were but one\nthought and one interest worth living for: how\nbest to serve thy God. Lest anything should\ndistract thee from this infinitely dear object, thou\ndidst flee into the desert. There, under the rule\nof the great patriarch, St. Benedict, thou wagedst\nwar against the flesh and the devil; thy tears\nwashed away thy sins, though so light if compared\nwith what we have committed ; thy soul, invigorated\nby penance, was inflamed with the love of Jesus,\nfor whose sake thou wouldst fain have shed thy\nblood. We love to recount these thy merits, for\nthey belong to us in virtue of that communion\nwhich our Lord has so mercifully established\nbetween saints and sinners. Assist us, therefore,\nduring the penitential season, which is soon to be\nupon us. The justice of God will not despise our\nfeeble efforts, for He will see them beautified by\nthe union He allows them to have with such\nglorious works as thine. When thou wast living in\nthe Eden of Camaldoli, thy amiable and sweet\ncharity for men was such, that all who came near\nthee were filled with joy and consolation: what\nmay we not expect from thee, now that thou art face\nto face with the God of love? Remember, too, the\nOrder thou hast founded; protect it, give it increase,\nand make it ever, to those who become its children,\na ladder to lead them up to heaven.\n\f"], [359, 142, 251, 34, "SEPTUAGESIMA\n\f"], [124, 137, 130, 40, "\f"]]}
