The Ark gives shelter to the just Noah,\nand to his family. The angry waters reach even to\nthe tops of the highest mountains ; but the frail yet\nsafe vessel rides peacefully on the waves. When the\nday fixed by God shall come, they that dwell in this\nArk shall once more tread the earth, purified as it\nthen will be; and God will say to them, as here-\ntofore to our first parents : \u2018Increase, and. multiply,\nand fill the earth.\u2019\n\nMankind, then, owes its safety to the Ark.

But\nif we can thus bless this contemptible wood,? how\nfervently should we love that other Ark, of which\nNoah\u2019s was but the figure, and which, for now\neighteen-hundred years, has been saving and bring-\ning men to their God! How fervently should we\nbless that Church, the bride of our Jesus, out of\nwhich there is no salvation, and in which we find\nthat truth which delivers us from error and doubt,?\nthat grace which purifies the heart, and that food\nwhich nourishes the soul and fits her for immor-\ntality !\n\nO sacred Ark! thou art inhabited, not by one\nfamily alone, but by people of every nation under\nthe sun.
