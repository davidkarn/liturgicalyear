Thy prayer\ndrew down a torrent of rain upon the earth; let it\nnow be offered for us, and obtain for us tears of\nrepentance. Thou couldst endure no conversation\nwhich had not eternity for its subject; give us a\ndisgust for useless and dangerous talk, and a relish\nfor hearing of God and of heaven. Thy heart had\nmastered the secret of fraternal charity, yea of that\naffectionate charity which is so well-pleasing to our\nLord ; soften our hearts to the love of our neighbour,\nbanish from them all coldness and indifference, and\nmake us love one another as God would have\nus love.\n\nDear dove of holy solitude! remember the tree,\nwhose branches gave thee shelter here on earth.\nThe Benedictine cloister venerates thee, not only as\nthe sister, but also as the daughter of its sainted\npatriarch. Cast thine eye upon the remnants of\nthat tree, which was once so vigorous in its beauty\nand its fruits, and under whose shadow the nations\nof the west found shelter for so many long ages.\nAlas! the hack and hew of impious persecutions\nhave struck its root and branches. Every land of\nEurope, as well as our own, sits weeping over the\nruins. And yet, root and branches, both must\nneeds revive; for we know that it is the will of thy\ndivine Spouse, O Scholastica, that the destinies of\nthis venerable tree keep pace with those of the\nChurch herself. Pray that its primitive vigour be\nsoon restored ; protect, with thy maternal care, the\ntender buds it is now giving forth; cover them\nfrom the storm ; bless them; make them worthy of\nthe confidence wherewith the Church deigns to\nhonour them!\n\f"], [378, 147, 251, 34, "SEPTUAGESIMA\n\f"], [141, 143, 130, 40, "\f"]]}
