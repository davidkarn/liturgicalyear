Her faith, too, is\nwavering; she is not sure that God may not have\ndeceived her, by threatening her with death should\nshe disobey His command. Flushed by pride, she\nlooks up to the forbidden fruit; it seems good to\neat, and it is fair to her eyes. So that her senses\ntoo conspire against God, and against her own\nhappiness. The sin is already committed in her\nheart; it needs but a formal act to make it com-\nplete. She cares for nothing but self; God is no\nmore heeded than if He did not exist. She stretches\nforth her daring hand; she plucks the fruit; she\nputs it to her mouth, and eats!\n\nGod had said that if she broke His command-\nment she should die; she has eaten, she has sinned,\nand yet she lives as before! Her pride exults at\nthis triumph, and, convinced that she is too strong\nfor God\u2019s anger to reach her, she resolves on\nmaking Adam a partner in her victory. Boldly she\nhands him the fruit, which she herself has eaten\nwithout any evil coming to her. Whether he was\nemboldened by the impunity of his wife\u2019s sin, or,\nfrom a feeling of blind affection, wished to share\nthe lot of her who was the \u2018flesh of his flesh and\nbone of his bones,\u2019 our first father, also, forgets all\nhe owes to his Creator, and, as though there had\nnever been aught of love between him and his God,\nhe basely does as Eve suggests: he eats of the fruit,\nand by that act ruins himself and all his posterity.\n\nNo sooner have they broken the tie which united\nthem with God, than they sink into themselves.\n\f"], [685, 222, 105, 30, "WEEK\n\f"], [229, 221, 456, 32, "TUESDAY OF SEPTUAGESIMA\n\f"], [271, 138, 600, 38, "TUESDAY OF SEPTUAGESIMA WEEK 135\n\f"]]}
