Outside\nthe garden of Eden, there lies the immense desert\nof the earth. It is to be the valley of tears; and\nthere must Adam dwell in exile for upwards of nine\nhundred years, with the sad recollection in his\nheart of the few happy days spent in paradise !\nThis desert is barren: Adam must give it fruitful-\nness by his toil, and draw from it, by the sweat of\nhis brow, his own and his children\u2019s nourishment.\nIf, in after ages, some men shall live without toil,\nthey are the exception confirming the general law\nand chastisement.
