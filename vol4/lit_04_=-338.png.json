Thy love makes thee more\nthan brave in thy sufferings, it makes thee forget\nthem. \u2018 Where wast thou,\u2019 we would ask thee in\nthe words of St. Augustine, \u2018 where wast thou, that\nthou didst not feel the goading of that furious\nbeast, asking when it was to be, as though it had\nnot been?

Thy eager hand directs the sword that is to\nset thee free ; and as the executioner severs the last\ntie that holds thee, how voluntary was thy sacrifice,\nhow hearty thy welcome of death! Truly, thou\nwast the valiant, the strong woman, that con-\nqueredst the wicked serpent! Thy greatness of\nsoul has merited for thee a high place among the\nheroines of our holy faith, and for sixteen hundred\n\f"], [640, 1305, 114, 39, "a\n\f"], [195, 142, 645, 41, "MARCH 6. $8.
