She\nsuddenly felt that the hand of\nGod was upon her, and being\noverwhelmed with intense\nsorrow for her sins, she went\nforth, and wept bitterly. She\nreturned to Alviano, cut\noff ber hair, laid aside her\ntrinkets, and, putting on a\ndark-coloured dress, she aban-\ndoned her evil ways and the\npleasures of the world. She\nwas to be found in the\nchurches, with a rope tied\nround her neck, prostrate on\nthe ground, and imploring\npardon of all whom she had\nscandalized by her past life.\nShe shortly afterwards set out\nfor Cortona, and there, in sack-\ncloth and ashes, she sought\nhow she might appease the\ndivine anger. For three years\ndid she try herself in the\npractice of every virtue: and\nat the end of that time, she\nobtained permission from the\nFriars Minors (under whose\nspiritual guidance she had\nplaced herself), to receive the\nhabit of the Third Order.\nFrom that time forward, her\ntears were almost incessant;\nand the sighs which deep con-\ntrition wrung from her heart\nwere such as to leave her\nspeechless for hours. Her\nbed was the naked ground ;\nand her pillow, a stone or\npiece of wood: so that she\nfrequently passed whole nights\nin heavenly contemplation.\nEvil desires no longer tor-\nmented her, for her fervent\nspirit was so prompt, that the\nweak flesh was made to labour\nand obey.\n\f"], [158, 195, 312, 810, "avianum reversa, crine\ndetonso, neglecto capite,\npullaque veste contecta,\nerroribus suis mundique\nillecebris nuntium misit ;\ninque sdibus Deo sacris\nfune ad collum alligato,\nhumi procumbens, ab om-\nnibus quos antea moribus\nsuis palam offenderat, ve-\nniam exoravit.
