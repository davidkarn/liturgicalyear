Now, perhaps more than in any\nother age, truths are decayed among the children\nof men ;! strengthen us in our faith, get us light.\nCheck the conceit of those shallow self-constituted\nphilosophers, who dare to sit in judgment on the\nactions and decisions of the Church, and to force\ntheir contemptible theories upon a generation that\nis too ill-instructed to detect their fallacies. The\natmosphere around us is gloomy with ignorance ;\nloose principles, and truths spoilt by cowardly com-\npromise, are the fashion of our times; pray for us;\nbring us back to that bold and simple acceptance of\nrath, which gives life to the intellect and joy to the\neart.\n\nPray, too, for the grand Order which loves thee\nso devoutly, and honours thee as one of the most\nillustrious of its many glorious children. Draw\ndown upon the family of thy patriarch St. Dominic\nthe choicest blessings, for it is one of the most\npowerful auxiliaries of God\u2019s Church.\n\nWe are on the eve of the holy season of Lent,\npreparing for the great work of earnest conversion\nof our lives. Thy prayers must gain for us the\nknowledge both of the God we have offended by our\nsins, and of the wretched state of a soul that is at\nenmity with its Maker.
