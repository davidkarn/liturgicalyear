Hail, then, spotless Mirror of justice !\n\nO Mary! beautiful in thine unsullied holiness,\npray for us who are weighed down by the conse-\nquences of that sin of our first parents, which God\nwould not suffer to approach thee. Thou art the\nimplacable enemy of the serpent; watch over us,\nlest his sting inflict death on our souls. We were\nconceived in sin, and born in sorrow; pray for us,\nthat we may so live as to merit blessing. We are\ncondemned to toil, to suffering, and to death ; inter-\ncede for us, that our atonement may find acceptance\nwith our Lord. We are exposed to the treachery of\nour evil inclinations; we are in love with this pre-\nsent life; we forget eternity; we are ever striving\nto deceive our own hearts: how could we escape\nhell, were the grace of thy divine Son not unceas-\ningly offered to us, enabling us to triumph over\nall our enemies?
