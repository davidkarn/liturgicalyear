But God had pity on the bride of Christ, and\nfor her deliverance He would use human agency:\nHe chose thee, Peter, as His principal co-operator\nin restoring order. Thy example and thy labours\nprepared the way for Gregory, the faithful and\ndauntless Hildebrand, into whose hands the keys\nwere no sooner placed, than the work of regenera-\ntion was completed. Thou hast fought the good\nfight; thou art now in thy rest; but thy love of\nthe Church, and thy power to help, are greater than\never. Watch, then, over her interests. Obtain for\nher pastors that apostolic energy and courage,\nwhich alone can cope with enemies so determined\nas hers are. Obtain for her priests the holiness\nwhich God demands from them that are the salt of\nthe earth.2 Obtain for the faithful the respect and\nobedience they owe to those who direct them in the\npath of salvation. Thou wast not only the apostle,\nthou wast moreover the model, of penance in the\nmidst of a corrupt age; pray for us, that we may\nbe eager to atone for our sins by works of mortifi-\ncation. Excite within our souls the remembrance\nof the sufferings of our Redeemer, that so \u2018His\nPassion may urge us to repentance and hope.\nIncrease our confidence in Mary, the refuge of\nsinners, and make us, like thyself, full of filial\naffection towards her, and of zeal that she may be\nhonoured and loved by those who are around us.\n\f"], [65, 156, 87, 18, "BR\n\f"], [233, 133, 609, 40, "FEBRUARY 23.
