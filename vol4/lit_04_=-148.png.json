She ought to refuse all inter-\ncourse with Satan; she does not; and thereby she\nimperils the salvation of the whole human race.\n\nLet us recall to mind the events that have\nhappened up to this fatal hour. God, in His\nomnipotence and love, has created two beings, upon\nwhom He has lavished all the riches of His good-\nness. He has destined them for immortality; and\nthis undying life is to have everything that can\nmake it perfectly happy. The whole of nature is\nmade subject to them. A countless posterity is to\ncome from them, and love them with all the tender-\nness of grateful children. Nay, this God of good-\nness who has created them, deigns to be on terms\nof intimacy with them; and such is their simple\ninnocence, that this adorable condescension does\nnot seem strange to them. But there is something\nfar beyond all this. He, whom they have hitherto\nknown by favours of an inferior order, prepares for\nthem a happiness which surpasses all they could\npicture with every effort of thought. They must\nfirst go through a trial; and if faithful, they will\nreceive the great gift as a recompense they have\nmerited. And this is the gift: God will give them\nto know Him in Himself, make them partakers of\nHis own glory, and make their happiness infinite\nand eternal. \u2018Yes, this is what God has done, and\nis preparing to do for these two beings, who but a\nwhile ago were nothing.\n\f"], [259, 153, 597, 40, "MONDAY OF SEPTUAGESIMA WEEK 131\n\f"]]}
